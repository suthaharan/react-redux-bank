#### React Redux

##### Principles of Redux
* Single source of truth
* State is read only
* Changes are made with pure function

##### Steps in Redux

* Reducer (has State and Action to be performed based on State)
* Subscribe (subscribe to the base where base contains the State)
* Dispatch (commands to invoke methods)
